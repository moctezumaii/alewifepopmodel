#### Model assumptions
***
This model was developed to compare management scenarios, not to make detailed predictions about the exact number of alewife that will return in a given time frame.  This model can be used to explore general trends and compare the results of scenarios when different average values are used as inputs



***

* There was no annual environmental variability built into the model
* Inputs are averages
* All spawning habitat was considered to be of the same quality
* All density-dependent mortality is included in the recruitment curve
* In the absence of dams, fish distribute throughout the system according to habitat availability

*** 

**These assumptions must be kept in mind when interpreting the results of this model!**
